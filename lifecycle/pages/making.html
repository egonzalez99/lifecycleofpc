            <h1>The Beginnings of PC</h1>
            <p>The beginning of personal computers were not invented to be use in homes because of how enormously big and expensive. Since they 
            were exclusively used by engineers, and other specialists that were using them for projects, research, and any other specialites.  
            During the beginning, computers are inferior to our current technology, but were tremedously valued in the past because of the 
            multiple applications and computations. Even though, computers had slower runtime and processing speeds they were still faster than 
            manpower. The origins of the PC can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with the development of early computing machines such as the ENIAC and UNIVAC. 
            These massive machines, initially used for military and scientific purposes, laid the groundwork for subsequent innovations in computing technology.
            In the 1940s, Bell Labs introduced transistors; which is a device that can amplify the communication and power throughout the 
            the machine. </p>
        
            <h1>The Golden Age</h1>
            <p>As the development and investments increased each decade it resulted in PC's getting smaller, powerful, and cheaper. 
            The advent of the microprocessor in the 1970s paved the way for the rise of the personal computer. Companies like IBM and Apple 
            played pivotal roles in popularizing PCs, introducing landmark products such as the IBM PC and the Apple Macintosh. WHich would become 
            massive players in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. The 1980s witnessed the emergence of the PC industry as a dominant force in the technology sector. 
            The introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and operating systems like MS-DOS and Windows revolutionized the user experience,
            making PCs more intuitive and user-friendly. These would fundamentally bridged the gap between man and machine by making them less trivial
            The 1990s saw explosive growth in the PC market, fueled by advancements in hardware and software technology. The advancements of the internet
            and the development of multimedia applications further accelerated the adoption of PCs, transforming them from productivity tools into multimedia 
            hubs  and communication platforms. </p>
            </p>

            <h1>The Modern Age</h1>
            <p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century has brought new, enhanced breakthroughs such as streamline operations, more complexity, and 
            artifical intellengence. This era has increased our dependence on technology for both good and bad, which is resulting in mixed reactions. 
            Either way it has made our lives easier by decreasing the  computing times, increased accessibility, and made practices more uniform.
            WHile, smartphones have become incredibly compact and powerful with each interation. Personal computers are still prevalent, and significant
            in the world. Also, hybrid devices have made the PC ecosystem more diverse and dynamicc  than ever before, which complements our society.
            In the future, the history of personal computers will continue it's legacy of constantly evolving and >breakthrough in almost every industry.
            The personal computer will make us feel more connected and impact each generation by shaping our reality. </p>
