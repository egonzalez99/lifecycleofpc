                <p>Microsoft is a major player in the cloud computing market by offering Azure. Cloud computing
                   was seen as a niche market and infrastructure to invest like 10+ years. However, Microsoft saw an 
                   advantage in the market by becoming an early investor. Azure has been an essential tool in databases,
                   analytics, networking, and artifical intelligence. Now A.I. is being implemented into our society at a fast pace with 
                   some controversal outlook on the job market, interactions, and envirnomental impact. Since it's really demanding it will require
                   more resources to be exported from facilities. </p>
