                    During the past decade Microsoft has developed multi - open source programs that aid developers with
                    reliable, and powerful tools. This is because of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella open source and ecosystem strategy.
                    Which has proven significant for the corporation's growth and leading the industry with new technology. This is 
                    a stark constrast to Microsoft's previous complicated relationship and views on open source.

                    Since the 1990s Microsoft has been increasing their portfolio by investing, purchasing.
                    and partnering with different companies. This strategy has helped them increase capotal, revenue, and
                    business growth. The corporation has acquired networking, game studios, and openAI to expand their impact on
                    various industries.
