            <h1>The Beginnings of PC</h1>
            <p>The beginning of personal computers were not invented to be use in homes because of how enormously big and expensive. Since they <br>
            were exclusively used by engineers, and other specialists that were using them for projects, research, and any other specialites.  <br>
            During the beginning, computers are inferior to our current technology, but were tremedously valued in the past because of the <br>
            multiple applications and computations. Even though, computers had slower runtime and processing speeds they were still faster than <br>
            manpower. The origins of the PC can be traced back to the mid-20th century, with the development of early computing machines such as the <br>ENIAC and UNIVAC. 
            These massive machines, initially used for military and scientific purposes, laid the groundwork for subsequent innovations in <br>computing technology.
            In the 1940s, Bell Labs introduced transistors; which is a device that can amplify the communication and power throughout the <br>
            the machine. </p>
        
            <h1>The Golden Age</h1>
            <p>As the development and investments increased each decade it resulted in PC's getting smaller, powerful, and cheaper. <br>
            The advent of the microprocessor in the 1970s paved the way for the rise of the personal computer. Companies like IBM and Apple <br>
            played pivotal roles in popularizing PCs, introducing landmark products such as the IBM PC and the Apple Macintosh. WHich would become <br>
            massive players in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century. The 1980s witnessed the emergence of the PC industry as a dominant force in the technology sector. <br>
            The introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and operating systems like MS-DOS and Windows revolutionized the user experience, <br>
            making PCs more intuitive and user-friendly. These would fundamentally bridged the gap between man and machine by making them less trivial<br>
            The 1990s saw explosive growth in the PC market, fueled by advancements in hardware and software technology. The advancements of the internet<br>
            and the development of multimedia applications further accelerated the adoption of PCs, transforming them from productivity tools into multimedia 
            hubs <br> and communication platforms. </p>
            </p>

            <h1>The Modern Age</h1>
            <p>The 21<sup>st</sup> century has brought new, enhanced breakthroughs such as streamline operations, more complexity, and 
            artifical intellengence. This era has increased<br> our dependence on technology for both good and bad, which is resulting in mixed reactions. 
            Either way it has made our lives easier by decreasing the <br> computing times, increased accessibility, and made practices more uniform.
            WHile, smartphones have become incredibly compact and powerful with each <br>interation. Personal computers are still prevalent, and significant
            in the world. Also, hybrid devices have made the PC ecosystem more diverse and dynamicc <br> than ever before, which complements our society.
            In the future, the history of personal computers will continue it's legacy of constantly evolving and <br>breakthrough in almost every industry.
            The personal computer will make us feel more connected and impact each generation by shaping our reality. </p>
