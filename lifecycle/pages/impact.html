              Microsoft was founded on April 4<sup>th</sup> 1975 in Alberquerque, New Mexico. The comapny was growing into the
              behemoth it would become in the 1990s-present day by making strategic business moves during the 1900s. The comapny 
              suppy the operating system for IBM in a licensed agreement instead of [IBM] buying Microsoft. The debuys of Microsoft
              Word, Windows 1.0, and IPO increased their control of the software/tech market and business growth. Also, Bill Gates and 
              Steve Jobs had a meeting during the Macintosh Project where Jobs showcased the different tech/applications that both companies 
              would collaberate on. However, the GUI presented problems where both were arguing about who stole what when developing their own 
              GUI.
